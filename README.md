### Project #6
Timeline: 2024.2.23 - 2024.7.8

This is a checkers game with a bot that uses the MiniMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to choose the best move, considering how far it had searched. It's the biggest project I've undertaken yet. Here are some things, but not all, that I've learned/improved during this project:
- Multithreading
- Templates
- Concepts
- Move semantics
- Ranges
- Lambdas
- Data structures
- Standard algorithms and containers
- Best practices

The more I leaned, the more refactoring I needed to do. Since the first prototype to this version, I improved the speed by more than 50 time and, believe or not, improved readability. There's much more that can be done to improve the speed, but I think 10 moves is good enough, and I better move on to another project.
